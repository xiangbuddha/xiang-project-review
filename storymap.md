Headline: Girard College: Inspiration for Arctic Explorers

Content box: Girard College was founded in 1833 as a residential school to serve "poor, white, male" orphans. However, the reason I'm interested in it is because Arctic explorer [Elisha Kent Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Kent_Kane) described the first iceberg he ever saw as "In shape an oblong cube, and about twice as large as Girard College."
