# assignments

This repository contains the materials you need in order to turn in the Group Project assignments and Reflections assignments.

## Getting started

Navigate to https://github.com/HIST5152/assignments.

Make sure you are logged into GitHub. It will show a small icon at the top right if you are logged in!

Create a repository from this template. [(GitHub documentation here)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
- Click the green "Use this template" button
- If you have more than one GitHub username, choose which username you would like to be the new repository's owner.
- Rename the repository if you want to, and add an optional description.
- Choose for the repo to be publicly visible.
- Click "create repository from template."

## Editing the documents
The folders in this repository already have template documents in them. These templates are editable and will be how/where you submit your assignments.

The editable documents are written in Markdown format (.md). Markdown works just like a normal text editor, but formatting (like bold, italic, bullet points, etc.) is slightly different. [(Here is a cheatsheet for how to do text formatting with Markdown if you're curious)](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

- Click on the assignment you wish to submit.
- Click the pencil icon at the top right of the window for that assignment's template.
- Follow the directions and guidelines for the individual assignment.
- When you're ready to submit the assignment
  - Type or paste any text into the designated part of the template document.
  - Paste any URL links into the designated part of the template document.
  - If you have an image or other file to upload from your computer, drag and drop it into the document. GitHub will turn it into a link, but don't panic! You can click the "Preview" tab at any time without losing your changes if you want to make sure everything looks ok.
  
 ## Submitting the documents
GitHub is a version control system, which means it will allow you to save multiple versions of a single document and be able to track the changes made each time. That makes it very convenient to submit assignments!
 **The next steps are very important!!**
 "Commit" your changes at the bottom of the page you are editing. 
 - Type "DONE" in the bigger text box (This will let me know that you are finished with the assignment). Optionally, you can type an extended description in the box.
 - Make sure the radio button is selected that says "Commit directly to the main branch."
 - Click the green button that says "Commit changes." **GitHub does not autosave!!! Don't forget to do this!!!**
