Projecti review:Buddhist Studies Place Authority Databases

Projecti review:[Buddhist Studies Place Authority Databases](https://authority.dila.edu.tw/place/) 

This repository of Buddhist texts available online includes the following geographical information: 1. The specific locations on the map of temples built between the 2nd and 14th centuries A.D. (exact latitude and longitude). 2. Information regarding the geographical location of cities in China from the 5th century B.C. to 1949 (exact latitude and longitude). 3. Information regarding the geographical location of mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans, mostly in the mainland of China. (Exact latitude and longitude).Because it is free and open to the public, anyone who is interested in Chinese and Buddhist geography can search for documents in this online repository to see if it contains any relevant information. It is important to point out that the online repository not only offers accurate latitude and longitude coordinates as well as downloadable KML files, but it also offers historical publications pertaining to a specific region. For instance, not only are we able to search for the latitude and longitude of a temple in China, but after the location of the temple, we are also provided with extensive information regarding the history of the temple. The primary documentary sources of this historical information are listed below: [AuthorityProject](https://authority.dila.edu.tw/AuthorityAbrr.php).This project in digital humanities was designed to assist academics of Buddhist geovisualization and digital humanities in acquiring trustworthy data that can be utilized for the purpose of conducting additional study on the topic. In addition, the purpose of this digital archive is to assist anyone interested in Chinese history in understanding and gaining a fundamental understanding of knowledge regarding Chinese historical geography. This includes assisting individuals interested in Buddhist geography in China.The design of the website is made much more understandable by the presence of two search forms, which are located on the left-hand side of the page. The reader can tailor their search to meet their specific requirements. The first search box features a place name search that can be used for either a general or an advanced search. The code authors will want to use the second search bar.The online archive can also be useful for teaching basic courses in Buddhism as well as basic courses in Chinese geography and history in educational institutions such as universities. In addition to providing reliable data for doctoral students and scholars familiar with Buddhism and the history of Chinese geography, the archive can also provide beginners and undergraduates with a quick and effective way to learn about Chinese geography. This is possible because the archive contains a large number of maps. Students have the ability to load the data onto QGIS and visualize the geographical location by freely searching the latitude and longitude coordinates that are provided in the archive.

Nonetheless, this project's deficiencies are obvious and require immediate adjustment.It is challenging to place certain time periods precisely due to the fact that the geographical locations of several ancient Chinese towns were distinct from those of modern cities. Therefore, ancient cities like Xiapi and Sutai, as well as others like them, which date back to the fifth century B.C., have evident faults in the geographical locations that they are attributed to (e.g., cities located in the south are marked as northern cities).
