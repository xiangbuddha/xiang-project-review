2. Work collaboratively to follow the directions and answer the questions below for each item by its due date. **Note: If you are not familiar with the "push," "pull" and "merge" functions of GitHub (not part of this course), I recommend using another collaborative text editor that you are familiar with to simplify the process of multiple people editing the document at the same time.**

## About this assignment
Collaboration is hard! But it's also a vital tool within workplaces and for working on projects with many moving parts. You'll be creating a final project with many moving parts by the end of this semester, and it'll be necessary to collaborate with several of your classmates to complete it. This can serve as a community for you to explore ideas and methods while you work to complete milestones in digital project management that you can bring with you beyond this course.

The thing about group work, is that you have to learn how to do it each time. This can be challenging, sometimes even frustrating, but it's a great learning opportunity that will pay off in a more robust and impactful end product. If you can cultivate a community of trust, respect, mutual understanding, and shared accountability, you'll create something that you can all be very proud of.

Of course, right now, it's possible that you hardly know your group members. That's totally fine, because you're going to get to know them a little better, and set some group goals, boundaries, and expectations before you even start to brainstorm about your final project's form.

## The Charter

### Basics
Assign the following roles to project member(s).
Who will serve as the group's...
- **Project Manager** _Moderates team discussion, keeps the group on task, and distributes work._

- **Recorder** _Takes notes summarizing team discussions and decisions, and keeps all necessary records._

- **Timekeeper/Planner** _Keeps the group aware of time constraints and deadlines and makes sure meetings start on time. Monitors progress on the work plan._

- **Reflector** _Assesses performance, interactions, and dynamics between team members, and intervenes with suggestions or strategies for improving the team‚Äôs process. Monitors adherence to the Team Charter._

### Goals
Individually, are there technologies/tools you want to learn or methodologies/approaches you want to explore?

What are the commonalities in your answers to the above question? Can you develop team goals that will meet each member's preferences?

What are group members‚Äô pet peeves from previous collaborations? How will you avoid these?

What will happen to the project when the semester is over? Will you maintain, update, or add to it?

### Meetings
How often will you meet outside of class? Where will you meet? Do you need a regular meeting time? If you‚Äôll schedule meetings as necessary, what days and times are generally good for people?

When are people planning to be out of town or especially busy? How can you work around this?

How will you prevent meetings from going off-track?

### Teamwork
Choose three words to describe the spirit in which your group will work together.

How will you communicate with each other (e.g., text messaging, email, Discord, Slack, Trello, etc.)?

Where will you store your files so that every group member can access them (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, server, Github, etc.)?

When you work on a document collaboratively, how will you ensure that you don‚Äôt overwrite each other‚Äôs changes?

Do all decisions need to be unanimous, or is ‚Äúmajority-rules‚Äù OK?

What other rules can you agree on to help meet our goals and expectations?
